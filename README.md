	Luci Evol (they/them) — also known as Evolvoodoo in the digital world — 
I'm a multifaceted creative professional with a passion for bringing ideas to life through the power of visual storytelling. 
Based in Atlanta, I offer expertise in photography, videography, photo editing, and 3D animation, serving clients across 
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

	My journey began with a fascination for technology, exploring photo and video editing since high school. 
My creative curiosity eventually led me to study chemistry in college, where I somehow developed more of a knack for 3D design, 
world-building, and animation using Unity and Unreal Engine than chemistry. Over the years, I have honed my craft in digital 
production, creating compelling visual content for various projects.

	With advanced proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects, 
I specialize in producing polished photos, engaging videos, and dynamic animations for intros, logos, and explainer content. 
With a strong background in coding, I also excel in game development, integrating 3D environments and assets into captivating 
experiences. Whether you need high-quality visual assets, expertly edited footage, or custom animations, I am dedicated to 
making your vision a reality with a focus on quality and creativity.

Let's collaborate to bring your creative projects to life!
